# Unlab_SR100
Developing UWB ToA/AoA RTLS using SR100 module

#### Extract distance and angles between SR100 UWB Tag and Anchor.
#### SR100 Responder(Anchor) can acheive distance and aoa azimuth.

## Version Differences

#### ver1. Calculate position using only distance and angle(aoa azimuth)
#### ver2. Extended Kalman filter version that uses distance and angle to input variables of filter.
#### ver3. skipped.
#### ver4. Using Kalman filter that uses reference position to input varialbes to correct position errors
